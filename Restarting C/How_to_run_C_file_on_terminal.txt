Running a C program in the terminal on Windows involves a few steps. Here's a basic guide:

1. **Install a C Compiler**: 
If you haven't already, you'll need to install a C compiler. One popular option is the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). 
You can install GCC on Windows using MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) or Cygwin. 
Alternatively, you can use Microsoft's Visual Studio C++ Compiler if you have Visual Studio installed.

2. **Write Your C Program**: 
Use a text editor like Notepad, Visual Studio Code, or any other text editor of your choice to write your C program. 
Save the file with a ".c" extension.

3. **Open Command Prompt**: 
Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

4. **Navigate to Your C Program's Directory**: 
Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your C program is saved. 
For example, if your program is saved in the "Documents" folder, you would use:
   ```
   cd Documents
   ```

5. **Compile Your Program**: Use the C compiler to compile your program. If you're using GCC, the command is usually:
   ```
   gcc your_program.c -o your_program
   ```
   This command will compile your C program into an executable file named "your_program.exe".

6. **Run Your Program**: Once your program is compiled successfully, you can run it from the Command Prompt:
   ```
   your_program.exe
   ```
   Replace "your_program" with the actual name of your executable file.
